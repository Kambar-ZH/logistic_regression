# Logistic Regression from the Scratch
### Case Study: Determine whether a person makes over 50K a year
The main objective of this set of notebooks is to implement Logistic Regression from the scratch. We start this process by deriving negative log likelihood for the Logistic Regression. Then, logistic regression model will be created by optimizing negative log likelihood function using gradient descent. Additionally, as a case study, we will show how to design a simple Machine Learning model for predicting whether a person makes over 50K a year using census data.So key features of this notebook:

In the second notebook, we will explore further topics such as regularization and handle large datasets using mini-batch gradient descent.So key features of these notebooks are:

* Derive negative log likelihood of the Logistic Regression.
* Build Logistic Regression model from the scratch using Python/Numpy.
* Basic building blocks ( written as Python functions) of the Logistic Regression model will be tested using unit tests.
* Run the Logistic Regression algorithm against a simple 2D dataset.
* Explore regularization
* Apply logistic regression algorithm for practical datasets.

### Install
This project requires python 2.7 and following Python libraries installed.
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory logistic_regression/(that contains this README) and run the following commands:

`ipython notebook logistic_regression_[1|2].ipynb`

This will open the IPython Notebooks file in your browser.
